RHmm package version 0.9.0

Make instructions
-----------------

Since I don't know how to use autoconf, I don't know how to test if the gnu gsl library is present and where are the gsl/include and gsl/lib directories.
If you have this library installed
	1) open the RHmm/src/Makevars or RHmm/src/Makevars.win files.
	2) change the definitions of PKG_LIBS and PKG_CXXFLAGS 


There are two Preprocessor directives :
	_RDLL_ : to create the shared library used by R
	_GSL_ : if the program uses the gnu gsl library

Somme source and headers files are used only for the shared library use by R (for example, RHmm.cpp or RUtil.cpp) 
other are uses to be used outside R (for instance R_EQuivalents.hpp)
